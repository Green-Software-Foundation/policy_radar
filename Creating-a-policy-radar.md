## Creating a policy radar in the GSF

This proposal is currently a work in progress - it’s shared to guide a
discussion that should lead to us agreeing on an approach later in Q3/Q4 for
allocating GSF sta resources to creating a policy radar.

This proposal outlines how we may go from an earlier accepted submission to create such a
policy radar, to a minimal rst step that can be useful to members in the GSF.

### The proposed solution as described in the proposal
The earlier proposal suggested what amounts to a forward looking calendar, that all members
could consult, and ideally either submit suggestions themselves or make edits:

A collaborative, public view of coming policy events (consultations,
new bills, laws being passed etc) in regions relevant to GSF members
(essentially a collaborative, public calendar)

This was left intentionally open, to avoid prescribing any specic technology because at the time,
we didn’t know what restrictions existed on tooling.

We also did not want to exclude members who can contribute knowledge, but might not be
familiar with Github, source control or markdown formatting.

To be clear - a rst version of this could be as simple as a table listing the dates of various laws
coming into eect, listed in in reverse chronological order, on a universally accessible website.

### The complication
There are many well developed solutions for collaborating on structured data - examples like
Notion, Conuence, and Outline exist.

However this is complicated by the following:

#### Licensing and permissions
One option might be to use commercial o the shelf software. Within a single organisation this is
likely the default option. Across the members of the GSF, managing accounts is much more
complicated.

#### Domain access
Some members are unable to access programs available on well known domains that might
otherwise be used.
Some of our members have Github’s domains blocked.
Some of our members have Google’s domains blocked.

#### Varying skills and experience with default tools
Not everyone with policy experience relevant to green software is comfortable using github,
markdown and other tools.

### What should we do?
Create the simplest calendar possible, that can be viewed in a place accessible to current policy
WG members, but can also be embedded elsewhere to get around the Google / Github domain
issue.

One such example might be to maintain structured data in a repository of some kind, and
present a view on this data on a dedicated page, on the new http://wiki.greensoftware.foundation
website - which is accessible to all GSF members.

As long as the kinds of data laid out below can be stored, and returned in the required order, the
kind of repository is not that important. Google sheets, a database - it doesn’t matter, as long as
we can use other software to provide a view on the data to get around the banned domains issue.

Similarly, we’d provide a basic form to accept submissions from members who can not use
Google, Github, or other banned software. Ideally have an automatic mechanism to add the
submission to the structured data repository, but periodically, and manually reviewing
submissions to add to the same structured data repository is also acceptable.

Our view is that the nal choice of technology should be down to the people implementing and
maintaining the solution.

### What information do we need to see?
To build a calendar we likely need a minimum of the following elds for data:
