The Policy Radar's primary goal is to proactively engage with policymakers and shape future legislation, fostering a deeper understanding of the policy landscape and enabling members to participate effectively in policy development.Benefits
Knowledge Building: Members will be informed about upcoming laws and potential engagement opportunities, leading to improved laws, better green software adoption outcomes, and enhanced public discourse understanding.
Tech Culture: The Policy Radar will promote greener procurement incentives, support sustainability within the workplace, and drive transparency for greener software development.
Tooling: It will increase the likelihood of new legislation being effectively implemented by practitioners and promote wider adoption of useful standards for green software development.
Scope and Focus

The Policy Radar primarily focuses on future legislation and policy development, rather than providing guidance on complying with existing laws. This proactive approach aims to benefit all members by fostering a shared understanding of the policy landscape and facilitating collaborative engagement opportunities.Rationale

Providing comprehensive guidance on existing laws for all members with diverse contexts would be a considerable undertaking for the GSF. Many GSF members already offer services related to existing law implementation. By contrast, the Policy Radar's focus on future legislation offers benefits to all members, enabling them to make informed decisions about engagement and collaboration within the evolving policy landscape.
