# Policy Radar

The Policy Radar project is designed to proactively track and analyze forthcoming legislation and policies significantly affecting our industry sectors. By closely monitoring these developments, this initiative will create valuable opportunities for the GSF to engage in collaborative efforts to address and mitigate potential impacts, thereby fostering a more resilient and informed response to changing regulatory landscapes.

**Tech Culture:** The Policy Radar is committed to promoting greener procurement practices while supporting sustainability initiatives within workplaces. It strives to drive increased transparency in the development of greener software, ensuring that environmental considerations are prioritized in technology-related decision-making.  

**Tooling:** Fostering connections between legislation and practitioners enhances the likelihood that new laws will be effectively implemented. Furthermore, the initiative promotes the broader adoption of beneficial standards for green software development, facilitating a collaborative approach to sustainability across the tech industry.

## Scope and Focus

The Policy Radar primarily focuses on future legislation and policy development rather than guiding compliance with existing laws. This proactive approach benefits all members by fostering a shared understanding of the policy landscape and facilitating collaborative engagement opportunities. Rationale

Providing comprehensive guidance on existing laws for all members with diverse contexts would be a considerable undertaking for the GSF. Many GSF members already offer services related to existing law implementation. By contrast, the Policy Radar's focus on future legislation benefits all members, enabling them to make informed decisions about engagement and collaboration within the evolving policy landscape.
